This project investigates global lunar missions using data science and business intelligence tools.
We analyzed a dataset of over 150 moon missions, including details like launch dates, mission types, outcomes, spacecraft, and operators.

Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Power BI, we explored and visualized:

Mission frequency over time
Success rates by operator (NASA, ISRO, Roscosmos, etc.)
Most common launch vehicles and mission types
Outcome distributions and trends across decades
Case studies on missions like Chandrayaan-1, 2, and 3
Power BI dashboards were developed for interactive visualizations, allowing deeper insights into success trends, country-wise performance, and mission outcomes. Python was used for data cleaning and advanced analytics.

This project highlights how data science and BI tools can enhance our understanding of space exploration, support research, and inform future mission planning.
